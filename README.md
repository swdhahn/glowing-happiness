Engine from scratch, uses OpenGL to render window, but other than that, everything else made from scratch by me!!
Math library is programmed by me, made for fun, and to have an easy way to render stuff to the screen using familiar and easy code.



To run project:

- Open terminal in project folder
- Then run the following commands
- Then simply run the executable produced!

Linux:
```
cmake .
make
```

Windows: run command and open sln project in visual studio
```
cmake .
```
